# ZX Spectrum Code

A couple of programs I wrote in Sinclair Basic, along with a game typed out from Input Magazine.

- **fizz-buzz** - the fizz-buzz kata written in Sinclair Basic
- **warhammer** - a helper program for running warhammer fantasy battle games.  This only has an archery component to it.

- **Cavendish Fields** - a wargame that appeared in Input Mazagine
